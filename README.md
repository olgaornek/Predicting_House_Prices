# Predicting_House_Prices
The accurate prediction of housing prices is a significant issue for buyers, sellers and investors in real estate. A good model can make sure people can be smarter about their decisions, reduce risk and increase confidence in the market. 

In this work, some popular algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors  were implemented and compared on the Kaggle housing dataset. 

Data exploration and preprocessing helper, PandasAI, which is an AI assistant, was envolved. 

To verify the model the ANN model is being tested with the five popular error metrics Mean Error (ME), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),  Mean Percentage Error (MPE) & Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). 

The model was best for a Random Forest model. This project showcases the implementation of ML and AI tools to estimate the correct price of real-estate property.
